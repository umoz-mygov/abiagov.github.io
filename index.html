      as the winner of the 2015 gubernatorial election held in April 11 and April 25, 2015.
      On 27 June 2016, Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court, Abuja ordered Ikpeazu to vacate his office as governor
      upon allegations of false information and forgery of documents prior to the 2015 gubernatorial election.
